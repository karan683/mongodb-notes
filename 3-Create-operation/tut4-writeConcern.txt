What is writeConcern option ?
we have our client (eg shell or your application using the mongoDb driver) and mongoDb server (eg mongod)
let say you want insert one document in there or insertMany document in there and for update and that all (all the write the operations)
On the mongod server we have the storage engine , this is the storage engine resoponsible for storing the data on to the disk and for also managing it in the memory
So your write must end up in the memory here and then it stores in the disk
Now you can configure so the called writeConcern on your write operations like insertOne({},{writeConcern : {w: 1, j : undefined}})
j stands for the journal 
journal is additional file that the storage engine manages like a todo file 
journal can be kept to store the operations that storageEngine must do like write

If your server is down by some reason and then your write operations is written in the journal so when the server starts again it can lookup in that journal file so that your write operations is not lost and then saved to the database (it's like a backup todo list)




>  db.persons.insertOne( {name : "karan" , age : 20} , {writeConcern : {w : 0} }) 
{ "acknowledged" : false }
> db.persons.find().pretty()
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("6114c5de3934126e63be732e"),
        "name" : "karan",
        "age" : 20
}
This is default setting
