What is Atomaticy of any write operation ?
let say we have insertOne operation now such operation most of the time will succeed but it can fail or have an error while the document is inserted 
let say we have an document with fields name , age and hobbies , name and age is saved but server has an issue with hobbies , MongoDb protects you against this , it guarantees you an Atomatic transaction , transaction either succed as a whole or fails as a whole and it fails during the write the operation every thing is rollback (its on per document level (top level document))
But if you use insertMany then you don't get this (only the document failed is rollback and exact behavior depends on the ordered inserts and unordered inserts)
