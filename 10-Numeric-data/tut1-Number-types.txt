Number types 
1   Integers
2   Longs
3   Doubles


To be precise we can works with these 4 types of numbers in mongodb

Integers (int32) Only full Number (range is bigger)
Longs (int 64) Only full Number (range is much bigger)
Doubles (64bit) Numbes with Decimal Places (default datatypes mongodb uses if you don't pass any information)
High Precision Doubles (128bit) Numbes with Decimal Places



Doubles (Decimal values are approximated) not stored with high Precision (higher range before the decimal part)
High Precision Doubles (values are stored with high precision (34 decimal digits)) (higher range after the decimal part)
